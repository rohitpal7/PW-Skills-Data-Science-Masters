    "#Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "#Ans.\n",
    "#The filter method is a type of feature selection technique that uses statistical tests to evaluate the relevance of each feature independently of the machine learning algorithm being used. \n",
    "#The filter method works by ranking each feature based on a certain criteria or score, and then selecting the top-ranked features as the final set of features for training the model.\n",
    "#The filter method typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "#Compute a relevance score for each feature\n",
    "#Rank the features based on their relevance score\n",
    "#Select the top-ranked features"
