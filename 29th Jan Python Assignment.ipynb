    "<br>Here are a few built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "<br>print(): used to print output to the console.\n",
    "<br>len(): returns the length of a string, list, tuple, or other sequence.\n",
    "<br>int(): converts a string or a float to an integer.\n",

    "\n",
    "14. How is memory management in python ?\n",
    "<br>Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, using a system known as reference counting. This means that Python keeps track of the number of references to each object in memory, and automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used.\n",

    "<br>After the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt and type python to check if Python is installed and the path variable is set correctly.\n",
    "<br>If you see the Python interpreter prompt (>>>), then Python has been installed and the path variable has been set correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python ?\n",
    "<br>Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to indicate the scope of code blocks in Python, such as those for loops, if statements, and functions. \n",
