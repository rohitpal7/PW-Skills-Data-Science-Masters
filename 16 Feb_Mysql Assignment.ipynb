    "#Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "#Ans. \n",
    "#A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way to allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#SQL databases, also known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), are based on the relational model of data, which organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them. \n",
    "#SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manipulate and query data, which is a standardized language used to interact with the database\n",
    "\n",
    "#NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are not based on the relational model of data and do not use SQL for data manipulation and querying. \n",
    "#Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family, among others."
