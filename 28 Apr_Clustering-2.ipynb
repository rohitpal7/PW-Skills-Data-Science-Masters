    "#Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?\n",
    "#Ans.\n",
    "#Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that creates a hierarchy of clusters by either merging small clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive). \n",
    "#Unlike other clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be predefined. \n",
    "#Instead, the algorithm creates a hierarchy of nested clusters that can be visualized as a tree-like structure called a dendrogram.\n",
    "#Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques, such as K-means clustering or DBSCAN, in that it creates a hierarchy of clusters instead of a flat partitioning. \n",
